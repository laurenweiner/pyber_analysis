## Overview 

**Purpose of Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to inform PyBer management on various performance metrics relating to the type of cities they operate in.

**Total Fare by City Type**

Over 62% of total fares come from rides in Urban cities, and over 30% of total fares come from Suburban cities.

## Summary

Overall, the highest contributor to total fares is Urban cities and the lowest contributor to total fares is Rural cities.

**Recommendation #1** 

Continue to invest in expanding the number of drivers available in Urban cities, as it is the largest market. 

**Recommendation #2**

Seek to understand whether fares are higher in Rural cities due to longer trips or less availability. Depending on results, PyBer may look to increase the number of drivers available in Rural cities to decrease the average fare per driver.

**Recommendation #3**

Attempt to understand whether there is unmet demand in Suburban cities. If there is room in the market for more drivers, Suburban cities may become more profitable as the rides are longer than in Urban cities.
